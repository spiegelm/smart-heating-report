\chapter{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

%Anything that is interesting -- but you did not have the time to pursue -- fits into future work.

In the scope of this lab project we developed a reliable heating control infrastructure and the corresponding innovative mobile application.
We focused these implementations to build a solid basis for future projects to build upon.
In the following we outline a few interesting ideas that we did not have the time to pursue but that could be implemented as a future work.

%The developed web server builds a solid tested framework that stores and processes the collected data.
The developed system could be extended to track and predict user locations.
This would allow to dynamically adjust the heating schedule to react to spontaneous user behavior deviations and could further decrease the energy consumption and increase the users comfort level in certain cases.

As a part of this project we implemented a mobile application designed for Android smart phones.
Another possibility for future work would be an additional user interface that could show more complex data analysis suitable for devices with bigger screens.
