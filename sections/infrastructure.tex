\chapter{Infrastructure}
\label{sec:infrastructure}

The infrastructure implements a server-client design pattern and is divided into two parts:
The \emph{Server} part and the \emph{Local} part.
First, the server is an independent unit providing a public API to its clients.
Second, the local part is a client consuming the provided API to retrieve configuration from the server and populate it with data gathered from the deployed residential infrastructure.
Both parts will be explained in the following sections.
