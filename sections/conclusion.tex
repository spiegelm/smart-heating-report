%Give a summary on what you did and what the major results are.

The goal of this project was to develop a reliable heating control system for residential users.

This project consists of two major parts.
On the one hand there is the back end consisting of the local infrastructure monitoring and controlling temperatures and persisting this data on an accessible Web server.
On the other hand there is the front end mobile application offering a user friendly interface to configure and interact with the system.

During the development of this project a few issues occurred.
One of the main obstacles at the beginning of the project was the lack of detail in the thermostat documentation.
This resulted in a lot of time spent with debugging of the hardware and software components related to the chosen thermostats and their firmware.
A further complication was the limited hardware performance which resulted in inconsistent request handling.
For example, for certain requests the thermostat does execute but not acknowledge the request.
We introduced a system that takes care of these anomalies.
Our evaluation concludes that the adopted measures lead to a reliable heating control system.

Our proposed system of interacting but independent distributed systems provides a solid base for further developments in the area of residential smart heating systems.
