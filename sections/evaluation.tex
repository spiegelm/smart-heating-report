\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we will evaluate our set design goals and discuss our implementation in detail.
Further we will analyze our design decisions.
Where applicable the functional and non-functional requirements will be validated.

\section{Infrastructure}

This section follows the same structure as used in the previous Chapter~\ref{sec:infrastructure}.
The infrastructure consists of the server part and the local part and both are evaluated in the following sections.

\subsection{Server Infrastructure}

\subsubsection{Design Goals}

Section~\ref{sec:server_infrastructure_design_goals} lists the design goals defined for this project part.
Each design goal will be evaluated in a separate paragraph below.

\paragraph{Modularity and Extensibility}
