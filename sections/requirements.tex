\section{Functional Requirements}

Functional requirements are stated using use cases in the style of Martin Fowler\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case\#Fowler_style}}\footnote{\url{http://ontolog.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UseCasesMartinFowlerSimpleTextExample}}. Each use case is described by stating the main goal of the use case in its title, followed by the main success scenario as a list of steps. After that we list a series of extensions which describe a condition that leads to a different interaction depending on user input or the system's state.


\subsection{Register a Residence}
User has bought the smart heating system and would like to register his residence.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User opens the app and opens the registration screen
    \item User scans the RFID tag\footnote{Every element of the system is equipped with an RFID tag (Radio-frequency identification). More about this can be found in Section \ref{sec:server_infrastructure_models}.}
    \item System checks if RFID is not yet registered
    \item System registers residence with scanned RFID
    \item App shows empty home screen with no rooms
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Alternative} RFID already registered or invalid
\begin{itemize}
    \item At step 3, system fails to verify that RFID is not yet registered
    \item{If RFID is associated to a residence
        \begin{itemize}
        \item App shows the home screen of the registered residence
        \end{itemize}
        }
    \item {If RFID is associated to a thermostat
        \begin{itemize}
        \item App shows error message telling the user that he needs to scan the Raspberry Pi instead of a thermostat
        \item Return to primary scenario at step 2
        \end{itemize}
    }
    \item {If RFID is invalid
        \begin{itemize}
        \item App shows error message telling the user that he needs to scan a valid RFID
        \item Return to primary scenario at step 2
        \end{itemize}
    }
\end{itemize}
    
\paragraph{Alternative} NFC Adapter\footnote{A Near Field Communication adapter is necessary to allow the user's phone to scan the RFID tags on the elements of the system.} not available
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1a. App shows a manual scan button
    \item 1b. User taps the manual scan button and enters the RFID on the tag by hand
    \item Return to primary scenario at step 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Add a Room to a Residence}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User opens the app and opens the home screen
    \item User taps on the room he would like to add a thermostat to
    \item User scans the RFID tag
    \item System checks if RFID is not yet registered
    \item App shows the room's detail view with the newly added thermostat
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Alternative} RFID already registered or invalid
\begin{itemize}
    \item At step 3, system fails to verify that RFID is not yet registered
    \item{If RFID is associated to a residence
        \begin{itemize}
        \item App shows error message telling the user that he needs to scan the  thermostat instead of the Raspberry Pi
        \item Return to primary scenario at step 3
        \end{itemize}
        }
    \item {If RFID is associated to an already registered thermostat
        \begin{itemize}
        \item App shows error message telling the user that each thermostat can only be registered to a single room and tells him what room the scanned thermostat belongs to
        \item Return to primary scenario at step 3
        \end{itemize}
    }
    \item {If RFID is invalid
        \begin{itemize}
        \item App shows error message telling the user that he needs to scan a valid RFID
        \item Return to primary scenario at step 3
        \end{itemize}
    }
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Alternative} NFC Adapter not available
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2a. App shows a manual scan button

    \item User opens the app and opens the home screen
    \item User taps the room icon for the living room
    \item User taps the change schedule button
    \item App shows the heating schedule for the living room
    \item User changes the schedule, setting the desired heating times
    \item System changes the schedules and sends the update to the Raspberry Pi
\end{enumerate}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Extensibility}
    
    Since the development of such a smart heating system usually takes several years with a much larger group than just two people, one of our non-functional requirements is that these applications that we provide in the end should be extensible and can be continued to work on. For more ideas and features that came to mind during development but were not implemented yet, see Section \ref{sec:futurework}.
    \item \textbf{Reliability and Robustness}
    
    As mentioned before, most of the existing systems are either not used properly or even discarded after a while because they are too complex. Since we are aiming for a service that is easy to use and will stay in the user's home for a long time, we want to produce a system that is reliable and robust.
    \item \textbf{Backup}
    
    If the user changes phones, or even has to exchange vital elements of the system, he should not have to reinstall the whole system but rather can only exchange these elements and continue the service without any repercussions.
    
    \item \textbf{Usability}
    
    We want the user to enjoy working with the heating system to guarantee a long lasting deployment as well as the user getting all the benefits from it. 
\end{itemize}
