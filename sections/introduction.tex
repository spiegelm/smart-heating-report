This results in the need of easy to use tools that provide the end user with enough information to analyze the data but not overwhelm him with unnecessary details.

One of the areas in which easy to use tools are needed, is heating control.
For this specific area we developed our project, which consists of two parts: the infrastructure and the mobile application.
The infrastructure part gets the heating data and analyzes it while the mobile application provides an easy to use and well understandable visualization of the data.

With this project we want to fulfill this need and offer a easy to use mobile application that enables the user to control and analyze ... .
