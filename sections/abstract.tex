In this lab project we present a reliable heating control system for residential users.
This project consists of two major parts.
On the one hand there is the back end consisting of the local infrastructure monitoring and controlling temperatures and persisting this data on an accessible web server.
On the other hand there is the front end mobile application offering a user friendly interface to configure and interact with the system.
